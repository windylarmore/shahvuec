                            <p> Hey there! I’m looking for someone to do some work for a high fantasy, medieval project my friend and I are working on. Character concepts, scenes, etc. but in an anime/line art style (a more serious looking anime style as opposed to the more “chibi” or “kawaii” look.) All payments would be made via PayPal and in USD. Prices, I hope, can be negotiated—though I’m willing to pay well for friendly and able artists. Furthermore, I need someone who is willing Mine is killer queen already touched the door knob from JoJos 
Now that Cammie has merged with Kazu a couple of times I expect no less than a random anime line from her in Japanese Hello, My friend and I were feeling nostalgic about the anime on Philippine television back in the days, heck, we were even trying to do dubs and throw quotes at each other (with the matching voices) and making the other guess who we were portraying. Anyway, I tried to remember as much as I could but was stuck only to Dragonball or Ghost Fighter (hindi pa ito ang isangdaang porsyento ng aking lakas, Eugene) references and couldn't think of any other. Can you help me with some quotes I could. Anime Version Of Something like , Hello My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die Or Luke, I am your Father. I’ll start with an easy but favorite one. “Heh, nice job kid, you made me use 15% of my power”. I can't seem to see past it. As excited I was about this new character and her design, I feel like she's 70% of why I'm not connecting with this season. Most if not all of her appearances and antics look and sound like they're straight from some 2010 ecchi action anime. "Spend most of your life ruled by another, watch your race dwindle to a handful and then tell me what has more meaning then your own strength! I have in me the blood of a saiyan prince, he is nothing but a joke yet I have had to watch him surpass me in strength my destiny thrown to the wayside, he's even saved my life as if I were a helpless child, he has stolen my honour and his debts must be payed!" Also I kinda like this speech too. "I was the perfect warrior cold and ruthless I lived For me, i'm gonna go with Gintama(well more of a pipe dream, but i can still dream right? lol), because almost all the jokes and humor in that anime are based on very obscure Japanese pop culture references and thus makes it impossible for it to have an english dub.But that's just my 2 cents on the matter, i'm more curious to hear everyone else's thoughts. As I'm watching I tend to find moments where the characters words really stick out to me and stays in my head. Either because what they said was really moving or extremely funny. Just wanted to see. Post line and/or catchphrase as well the anime. This season is almost over and has a wide variety of great characters that have helped make a terrific spring line up. Characters ranging from Maou of Hataraku Maou-sama to Misaka of Railgun are all terrific and have their own special personalities that help make the anime what it is. But if you had to choose one specific character, who is your favorite!? My pick is just an attempt to be unique, but my favorite character from this season is Chihaya (http://25.media.tumblr.com/60c01b79409e6a9b9. 
Im totally hyped up for the upcoming season but I think something is missing. And that is a direct follow up season from a spring season show. Example of it this season is assassination classroom. (if im not mistaken) Does that mean this season is shit that they (the studios) dont wanna continue their shows? I believe not, because IMO, Im more hyped when spring started with more good shows than this upcoming season. Please let there be atleast one! (BnHA is possible, but I personally. Been reading the manga, and have been planning to re-watch beck for a while. Thought I'd watch the show and just pick the manga at the point where the anime ends. Which I understand is volume 11. How similar are the later parts of Beck to the manga equivalent chapters? Can I do a seamless transition from the anime to the manga like you can with for example The Flowers of Evil? Thanks So, in an effort to consume/intake as much Japanese as possible, I've taken to watching anime. Background: I've been watching Fairy Tail, and there's a line "全天８８星" which I've gathered means something like "all 88 stars of heaven" - the romaji being "Zenten hachijuuhassei" as per the script I found (to confirm what I was hearing). My Question: If hachijuu hatchi is 88, what is the "sei" here? Is it a counter? I've never seen it before. I looked up the kanji and saw it means "star". </p>
