                            <p> WOO! Even got the email from STEAM that's it available. All, I am building a 12.3 QS lab with a localized version of CFC (AM). When I go to install AM, It fails on finding C;\BOOTDRV\CFC - That is not a typo - that is what is in the error. Any Ideas. 
Has anybody got the update. Does anyone have a tested configuration for the ATampT camera (Serrcom OC432) for Homebridge? Homebridge is running on a Raspberry Pi 3+. I can get the camera into HomeKit but doesn’t capture still image or stream. I can see the stream through VLC and the image through a browser. Not sure if it is my camera config or my Homebridge config. I just picked up this game last night and was excited to finally get into it, but I keep experiencing a Delta 3 error (which crashes me to the main menu), and I can't enter safehouses or open certian tool boxes in the world. Is the game having problems today or am I doing something wrong? Is there I'm using Libreelec on a Raspberry Pi 3 as the basis of a carputer/infotainment center. Kodi is working great for music playback, and I'd like to try and add podcasts. I've only got wifi when the car is parked, so I'd like to download podcasts whenever the car is parked overnight. This game was released in 2007 and PS3 was made in 2006, and on PS3, you get around 45 FPS on 1080p, this is just totally ridiculous. I’am a PC gamer over 10 years, unfortunately I had to sold my GTX1080, so I want to move to my old ps3 for now, I’ve been playing only in Project Dive (a hardcore rhythm game) long time ago, but after I finish Demons Souls and Final Fantasy XIII and lunching this Assassins Creed, I just can’t believe of HOW SH T CONSOLES ARE COMPERING TO A GAMING PC!!! I made a post a while back and clearly Samsung didn't I Currently have two loans out but are surely on track for repayment. I also want to apologize for being that guy but I don’t really have any help or family besides siblings and mom. So to make a long story short, I was able to get myself a used (but new) car last week with the help of a previous lender and with that, I managed to get myself into another place of employment so eventually I can stop loaning and become a lender. I know at this point I should be the one lending but I am still learn. 
I've got these sweet Osram LED fog lights, but I haven't found any tutorials on the internet about how to replace my car's fog lights. Does anyone have any tips, videos, or pictures? Thanks. Samsung should have only done the stupid clock on the left thing without am or pm for the S10 series because they have the cutout. The Note 9 and other Samsung devices with the infinity display didn't need to move the clock. It was just Google changing it for notches. I know this is a minor thing but it really bugs me. I also know you can use goodlock to move it back to the right but then it hides a bunch of icons too. Maybe if we put in feedback to goodlock Samsung would bring back AM/PM. I am currently running Manjaro KDE (KDE Plasma 5.15.3/KDE Framework 5.56.0/Kernel 4.19.32-1-MANJARO). I have installed a few software with Trizen, Snap and Octopi. Edit 1: I am looking for software such as office software, a place to store academic references in multiple formats, notetaking software–essetially the basic university package. 
Any way of installing a port for the Mi a1? Based on some light reading I know that the device has to be "certified" by Google to run it, but that does not mean it's not possible ;-). Any way of installing it or any older fully working version on the a1? I'm running Rooted Pie with January security patch. Im trying to manually install an application in my usr/bin folder. but when i try to move the program in it says access denied. Im very new to linux, this is my first week in Solus so go easy on me. Do i need to gain root access. </p>
