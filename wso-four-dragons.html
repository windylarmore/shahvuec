How Dragons came to be? International Folk Tales for Kids  Level 4-4 The Four Dragons Kids' Classics Readers from Seed Learning - Duration: 4:46. Seed Learning 39,072 views.  Four Dragons teaches a blended Traditional style of martial arts combining various aspects and techniques from karate, tae kwon do, arnis, and classical jiujitsu into one practical and easy to learn system. Four dragons on the sword during the intro. Anyone Here's the last scene in question of the astrolabe. I forgot what it's officially called. (https://reddit-uploaded-media.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/images%2Ft2_6l3pm%2Fog6py8qezcs21) There are 4 dragons on the last astrolabe ring. With the common animals (the other Houses of Westeros) bowing to the larger dragon. This larger dragon is Drogon/Daenarys. I think this means that Daenarys rules and has three children from Jon (who more than likely dies). If there were two then I think that would. 
In the new intro, you can see these 4 dragons and a comet in the sky. Comets mean Dragons. (Season 2) Could the theory about the sleeping dragon underneath Winterfell be true? A comet for a dragon waking up after centuries in hibernation? https://imgur.com/a/ppusEcp (https://imgur.com/a/ppusEcp). So the astrolabe showed four dragons in Sunday nights opening credits. My theory is that they symbolize four living Targaryens: -Daenerys Targaryen -Jon Snow (Lyanna and Rhaegar's son) -Tyrion Lannister (Joanna Lannister and the son of either Aerys or his father Jaehaerys) -Gendry (son of Robert Baratheon and Rhaella Targaryen, twin of Daenerys) Aerys and Rhaella Targaryen hated each other. Also seems suspicious that she lost so many children between the birth of Rhaegar and Viserys. Did you notice the four dragons during the opening credits. Hello! I have four Dragon postcards (https://imgur.com/Gm8h4E5) to exchange. These postcards will be posted with the recently released USPS Dragons stamps (https://www.usps.com/ecp/asset/images/477504-Z0.jpg). Here's what you gotta do: 1. Comment which one you'd like (~~top left~~, ~~top right~~, ~~bottom left~~, ~~bottom right~~). No need to ask, just comment. 2. PM your address immediately after commenting. I won't be going after you or reminding you for your address. No address. I was thinking, maybe the reason why the four dragons need to be close to the castle to be completely well is so no other nation or country can use the dragons powers? Like if another empire were to try and use the dragons they wouldn’t be able to because they would be weakened. That way no one other than king hiryuu can actually use their power. He stood on the corpse, shoulders heaving. Blood dribbled down his arm, staining the chainmail red. A dragon. He'd done it. He'd really done it. Almost despite himself, a grin spread across his face from ear to ear. The cries rang up from around him, the soldiers and mages scattered around the gorge cheering as he raised his spear in victory. It was dead. He killed it. He'd won. Slowly, still trembling from exertion, he slid down the beast's mammoth leg. Hands grabbed </p>
